# EmployeeManagement
Process of Employee Registration, Updation, Deletion and Display(get).
This directory contains 
  - AWS Lambdas createEmp, deleteEmp, getEmp, updateEmp in Python.
  - All the lambdas are connected to the respective methods in a resource on my AWS APIGateway.
  - Lambdas can access the dynamoDB table "Employee" in my AWS Account to complete their functions.
I gave all the right permissions to Lambdas, API Gateway Resource and DynamoDB Table to complete this task.
